# game_characters_database
Database of game characters. Project is in PHP with OOP features involves CRUD, administration, role - admin, user, images upload etc.

It's focused primary on PHP not on Front-end technologies. FE here is really in basic mode. The main purpose of this project is to show my basic PHP skills. I don't focus on FE, I like back-end and this is what I want to focus it.

For testing the project you can use users who have been created: 
For login as admin use: username: administrator@database.com, password: admin123
                        username: admin@database.com, password: admin321

For login as user use: username: user@database.com, password: user123

I hope you enjoy my first project in PHP.
